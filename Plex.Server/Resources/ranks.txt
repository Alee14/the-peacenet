/* Rank example
 *
 * Ranks are used by the server to give players a sense of progression. As the user ranks up,
 * they earn perks such as more upgrade slots and a bigger MoneyMate budget.
 *
 * The rank system is also used by the server's world generator to generate cash and resources
 * for each NPC system in the world based on their rank.
 * 
 * Your server's economy ultimately depends on the budget given to each rank, and the amount of NPCs
 * generated for each rank, so we let you decide the values for each rank in this file.
 *
 * Note that ranks are ordered by experience, starting at 0. Rank 0 is the base rank, and its experience value is
 * completely ignored. All new players start at rank 0, so use it to set what your players can and can't do until they rank up.
 *
 * When you're ready, rename this file to 'ranks.json', and fire up your server, and the next phase of setup will begin.
 *
 *
 * Note: All cash values are expressed in cents. 500 = $5.
