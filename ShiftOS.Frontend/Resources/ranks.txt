//This file declares all ranks in the game, their requirements and their rewards.

//Although the engine orders ranks by the amount of experience required to gain them,
//for readability it's advised that all ranks in this file are ordered by experience from least to greatest.

//Values per object:
// - Name (required, string) - the name of the rank
// - Experience (required, 64-bit unsigned integer) - the amount of experience required to get this rank
// - UpgradeMax (required, 32-bit signed integer) - when the user has this rank, this is the max amount of upgrades they can have loaded at once
// - UnlockedUpgrades (optional, array of upgrade IDs) - when the user gains this rank, these upgrades will be unlocked.
